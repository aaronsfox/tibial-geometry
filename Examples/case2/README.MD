# Case 2: Generate Trabecular from Surface Mesh

*We recommend downloading a Markdown reader like [Typora](https://typora.io/) to view the readme files within this dataset.*





NOTES:

- Approach here is to demonstrate how to generate a volumetric trabecular mesh of the tibia from a tibia or tibia-fibula surface mesh and the relevant surface shape models
- Example tibia and fibula come from the rework of the [BodyParts3D/Anatomography project by Kevin Moermen](https://github.com/Kevin-Mattheus-Moerman/BodyParts3D) where .stl versions of these surface objects were created





DEPENDENCIES:

- GIBBON toolbox
- geom3d
- nonrigidICP from https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41396-nonrigidicp (with some edits to suppress the visualisations)
