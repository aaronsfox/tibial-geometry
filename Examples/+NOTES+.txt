Case 1 could actually be reconstructing from PCs at specified SD's
	> i.e. just one PC SD, or a combination of them...
	> This is therefore generating your own tibia surfaces
	> Use any number of PC's and sample from normal distributions to create X surfaces and visualise
	
Case 2 can then be generating the trabecula component

Case 3 from landmarks?

Case 4 from distances?
